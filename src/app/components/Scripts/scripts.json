    "shortStory": "As the eldest son of Duke Baroque, Lancelot was born rebellious. Dead set on resisting the political marriage arranged for him by his father, he traveled the country and led a licentious life instead. After being wounded at a drunken brawl in a tavern, Lancelot was rescued by Odette and finally came to realize what his heart truly yearned for. The prodigal son made a repentant return and thus began his adventure across the Land of Dawn.",
