Massive energy fluctuations came from the time rift. Aurora thought that Zhask had returned and that she would finally have the chance to avenge her beloved. But as it turned out, she saw someone who seemed to be even more powerful. Yve came down from the sky above the Frozen Ocean. She considered everything and everyone beneath her notice and was only interested in finding Zhask. Her instincts told her that her old nemesis had once appeared here. Yve simply glanced at Aurora with indifference, then turned and left. Just as Aurora was hesitating about whether to chase down this mysterious visitor, Yve released an explosion of tremendous energy, closing the time rift temporarily. She then turned and left.",

During a mission, he nearly lost his life but was saved by the Vermilion Bird; it was an encounter that would kindle his yearning for freedom. In a bargain to leave the Finch Sect, he undertook one last mission to infiltrate the Dragon Altar. It wasn't until he allied with Yu Zhong, the reincarnation of the Black Dragon, to break the seal of the Dragon Altar, that the spirit of the Vermilion Bird once again saved his life. Only then did he see the truth and understand the meaning of freedom. In this world, the Vermilion Bird had faded away, leaving only Ling, a young man with wings to soar freely among the clouds like the Cyan Finch.",
