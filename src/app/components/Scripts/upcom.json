    "shortStory": "In Eruditio—the City of Scholars, there's hardly anyone who doesn't know of Layla. She's the 'daughter of Eruditio', just like a bright star that shines over the streets of Eruditio in the darkness of night. Brave and selfless, she always had a bright and happy smile on her face while toting the gun handed to her by her grandfather, protecting Eruditio in her own way. As a child, Layla would always ask her grandfather about her parents, but his reluctance to tell her and his sad face told her it was something tragic. Because of that, Layla decided to never pain her grandfather anymore, so she stopped pursuing the matter. However, as secrets cannot be hidden forever, the truth of her birth eventually surfaced, and it turns out that her parents have always been watching her from the skies—well, in the literal sense.",

This night, and every night, the stars held her prisoner. She could only watch the tiny glimmers overhead and ruminate the story of her life over and over again.",

To preserve the delicate balance of power between the Shadow and Scarlet Sects, Hayabusa willingly took his brother's place to be a political pawn and hostage, to be raised within the rival Scarlet Sect. Every day spent in the Scarlet Sect, Hayabusa lived by his brother's principles.

Yet, he gripped his blade firmly, determined to forge ahead through the shadows, following his brother's nindo.",

On his world, auto racing was the most illustrious sport, but the major races were almost entirely monopolized by the rich and elite. One day, while on a routine delivery, Johnson became mixed up in a race and even managed to win first place March, to the dismay of the wealthy patrons. To punish this upstart, they plotted for him to have an accident. While driving home a speeding truck sidelined Johnson's car, mangling his body with the twisted steel of the wreck. Miraculously, he survived, and chose to be integrated with his car to create a cyborg body. After a successful operation, he had a roaring engine as his new heart, and began racing to satiate his need for speed. As Johnson raced to his heart's content, he kept going faster and faster until he triggered the slip-space device secretly built into his chassis and crossed into the Land of Dawn.",

Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

Miya became the Priestess of the Moon, and for thousands of years she served faithfully in the Lunar Temple, diligently watching over her people. However, with the continued expansion of the Abyss and its dark legions, the Land of Dawn is once again shrouded by the fog of war. From the Moonlit Forest, a call to war that has not been heard in thousands of years sounded again. Miya took up her silver bow and swore by the light of the moon to fight for her people.",

She's the 'daughter of Eruditio', just like a bright star that shines over the streets of Eruditio in the darkness of night. Brave and selfless, she always had a bright and happy smile on her face while toting the gun handed to her by her grandfather, protecting Eruditio in her own way. As a child, Layla would always ask her grandfather about her parents, but his reluctance to tell her and his sad face told her it was something tragic. Because of that, Layla decided to never pain her grandfather anymore, so she stopped pursuing the matter. However, as secrets cannot be hidden forever, the truth of her birth eventually surfaced, and it turns out that her parents have always been watching her from the skies—well, in the literal sense.",

For centuries, the Vortex incited discord among the desert tribes and harvested the dark energy borne from their bloodshed. Though the Vortex's insidious influence trapped the desert in a cycle of strife and anguish, the Vortex itself sought to be freed. Tempted with the promise of revenge, Moskov extracted the core of the vortex, the Spear of Quiescence, and was reborn in the power of the darkness. Now he roams the sands, seeking revenge upon Khufra in the name of the desert.",

Miya became the Priestess of the Moon, and for thousands of years she served faithfully in the Lunar Temple, diligently watching over her people. However, with the continued expansion of the Abyss and its dark legions, the Land of Dawn is once again shrouded by the fog of war. From the Moonlit Forest, a call to war that has not been heard in thousands of years sounded again. Miya took up her silver bow and swore by the light of the moon to fight for her people.",

It was from them that he learned the existence of death. While confused by this sudden revelation, he was mistaken by the pandas for the deity of the mountain. In particular, a small panda named Li Li became infatuated with Sun and devoted his days to picking peaches for the Monkey King. But when a flash flood struck the panda village one day, Li Li was lost to the torrents while looking for peaches. Sun arrived too late, and despite the pleas of the other pandas, he did not have the ability to bring his friend back from the dead. It was then that Sun experienced loss for the first time. Unable to comprehend his grief, he fell into a deep slumber. Millennia passed, and many more would have passed by had Sun not been awakened by a battle between dragons. After slaying the Black Dragon and unknowingly saving the Cadia Riverlands, he asked the Silver Dragon about immortality and finding one's purpose. Instead of the answer he sought, the dragon gave him the name Sun and the task of being the guardian of the land. But what does that entail? Sun was once again lost in though",

Though the Vortex's insidious influence trapped the desert in a cycle of strife and anguish, the Vortex itself sought to be freed. Tempted with the promise of revenge, Moskov extracted the core of the vortex, the Spear of Quiescence, and was reborn in the power of the darkness. Now he roams the sands, seeking revenge upon Khufra in the name of the desert.",

The Kingdom produced a lot of precious jade, which brought the Minoan people great wealth. Very quickly, the entire kingdom was lost in the intoxicating allure of gems. Even many mercenaries, tasked with guarding the sacred maze become corrupted, abandoning their duty. Only one stayed―Aldous, who had never forgotten his duty and guard the Minoan Labyrinth.",

But if someone could enter his world, they would realize how terrifying it is—the incessant howls and shrill cries constantly deafening his ears and heart. When he draws his demon-devouring weapons and unleashes a hail of bullets, the agonizing howls of demons become a requiem playing in the depths of his soul. Only the intertwining of their death shrieks and the sound of gunfire can drown out the noise that torments him daily. Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

    "shortStory": "Johnson was originally from a planet called Varis, where he worked as a delivery driver. On his world, auto racing was the most illustrious sport, but the major races were almost entirely monopolized by the rich and elite. One day, while on a routine delivery, Johnson became mixed up in a race and even managed to win first place March, to the dismay of the wealthy patrons. To punish this upstart, they plotted for him to have an accident. While driving home a speeding truck sidelined Johnson's car, mangling his body with the twisted steel of the wreck. Miraculously, he survived, and chose to be integrated with his car to create a cyborg body. After a successful operation, he had a roaring engine as his new heart, and began racing to satiate his need for speed. As Johnson raced to his heart's content, he kept going faster and faster until he triggered the slip-space device secretly built into his chassis and crossed into the Land of Dawn.",

She saw how the Abyss defiled the Shadow Swamp and corrupted many of her people into Dark Elves. It was not until the Moon Goddess created the Lunar Aegis over Azrya that the Moon Elves were able to thrive again under its protection. Miya became the Priestess of the Moon, and for thousands of years she served faithfully in the Lunar Temple, diligently watching over her people. However, with the continued expansion of the Abyss and its dark legions, the Land of Dawn is once again shrouded by the fog of war. From the Moonlit Forest, a call to war that has not been heard in thousands of years sounded again. Miya took up her silver bow and swore by the light of the moon to fight for her people.",

In her youth, she endured the torment of her innate prowess for Frost Magic until the disciples of the Light brought her to Queen's Peak, whereupon she received an infusion of light which granted her immortality. Tearfully, her mother bade her farewell as she succumbed to the cold embrace of blizzard. Aurora slumbered for a thousand years atop the peak. Upon her awakening, the truth dawned on her: genuine eternity lay in fleeting emotions, such as her mother's final comforting smile. Thus, Aurora resolved to bestow this eternity upon the world. It was at that moment that a legend was born in the North. The legend spoke of people close to death who would climb Queen's Peak, seeking the frigid embrace of the goddess there. If granted, all of the one's memories, longings, and emotions would be left tot he goddess, who would cherish them until the end of time. And thus, they would live on the eternity.",

It wasn't until he allied with Yu Zhong, the reincarnation of the Black Dragon, to break the seal of the Dragon Altar, that the spirit of the Vermilion Bird once again saved his life. Only then did he see the truth and understand the meaning of freedom. In this world, the Vermilion Bird had faded away, leaving only Ling, a young man with wings to soar freely among the clouds like the Cyan Finch.",

But if someone could enter his world, they would realize how terrifying it is—the incessant howls and shrill cries constantly deafening his ears and heart. When he draws his demon-devouring weapons and unleashes a hail of bullets, the agonizing howls of demons become a requiem playing in the depths of his soul. Only the intertwining of their death shrieks and the sound of gunfire can drown out the noise that torments him daily. Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

    "shortStory": "Sun, the immortal mountain spirit born from a magical stone, roamed freely between heaven and earth until one day, when the cries of a group of pandas caught his attention. It was from them that he learned the existence of death. While confused by this sudden revelation, he was mistaken by the pandas for the deity of the mountain. In particular, a small panda named Li Li became infatuated with Sun and devoted his days to picking peaches for the Monkey King. But when a flash flood struck the panda village one day, Li Li was lost to the torrents while looking for peaches. Sun arrived too late, and despite the pleas of the other pandas, he did not have the ability to bring his friend back from the dead. It was then that Sun experienced loss for the first time. Unable to comprehend his grief, he fell into a deep slumber. Millennia passed, and many more would have passed by had Sun not been awakened by a battle between dragons. After slaying the Black Dragon and unknowingly saving the Cadia Riverlands, he asked the Silver Dragon about immortality and finding one's purpose. Instead of the answer he sought, the dragon gave him the name Sun and the task of being the guardian of the land. But what does that entail? Sun was once again lost in though",

Natan stood as Eruditio's leader, guiding the people in their search for hope in this world. Yet having faced numerous defeats he decided instead to cast his gaze not to the future, but to the pastâ€”by inventing a time machine. As the world teetered on the brink of destruction, his time machine finally reached completion as it absorbed the combined power of the Twilight Orbs: Natan stepped within, and started searching the past for a chance to save the world.",

    "shortStory": "Among the four renowned members of Forsaken Light, one young man from the East stands out. Known as Yin, this simple and righteous martial artist sometimes exudes a sinister aura, creating a stark contrast that leaves many wary of him. Few know that his wild and violent behavior stems from the Evil God, Lieh, dwelling within him. He is the reason Yin left his home in the Cadia Riverlands—to hone himself in the Land of Dawn and find a way to defeat Lieh. But Yin's struggles in this foreign land have had the opposite effect; as a being that thrives on chaos, the more Yin fights, the faster Lieh can recover his power. Thus, Lieh began to impart his power to Yin, watching him sink deeper into madness with each act of righteousness and chivalry, and leading him toward the self-destruction Lieh desires. However, even knowing the risks, Yin continues to wield this power—because for him, abandoning his code and ignoring the suffering of others would make him no better than Lieh. Yin never backs down from a challenge, god or no god.",

    "shortStory": "Created by the Ancient Ones, Edith was the Primal Warden that watched over the sealed Evil Gods on the Sanctum Island. Awakened and injured in an earthquake, she lost her memories and was saved by her foster father who made a living by selling scraps and continued to raise her for ten years. When she once again helped her foster father enter the temple to search for scraps, the guardian of the ruins-Elemental Giant Uranus was prepared to destroy the invaders. It was then that Edith remembered everything, but her humanity overpowered her divine nature, and she fought Uranus to protect her foster father. Just then, the Celestial Palace fell and the sealed Evil Gods scattered. Edith parted with her foster father, drove her Mecha 'Phylax' and set out on a journey to hunt down fleeing Evil Gods.",

When she opened her umbrella in contemplation, she beheld not gentle rain but visions of calamity, eternities of regret, and a past seen through her umbrella. At last, Kagura understood: though born from lingering attachments, her path led toward freedom. She would carry both the regrets and hopes of those who had passed to experience the beauty of the mortal realm they were never able to, and embrace the future they were robbed of yet graciously bestowed upon her.",

Yet, he gripped his blade firmly, determined to forge ahead through the shadows, following his brother's nindo.",

The legends speaks of three thousand secret worlds, which upon entering, one must face various levels of psychic and physical trials and advance to world after world upon victory. The people of the Shura clan had discovered a way to enter these worlds, and only those who have conquered over three hundred worlds could be granted the title of Asura, raising them to the level of a demigod in the eyes of their people.

But Yin's struggles in this foreign land have had the opposite effect; as a being that thrives on chaos, the more Yin fights, the faster Lieh can recover his power. Thus, Lieh began to impart his power to Yin, watching him sink deeper into madness with each act of righteousness and chivalry, and leading him toward the self-destruction Lieh desires. However, even knowing the risks, Yin continues to wield this power—because for him, abandoning his code and ignoring the suffering of others would make him no better than Lieh.

    "shortStory": "As the second heir to the Shadow Sect of the Scarlet Shadow, Hayabusa had always looked up to his brother, a figure who he saw as the moon itself. To preserve the delicate balance of power between the Shadow and Scarlet Sects, Hayabusa willingly took his brother's place to be a political pawn and hostage, to be raised within the rival Scarlet Sect. Every day spent in the Scarlet Sect, Hayabusa lived by his brother's principles. He mastered his unique Shadow Shuriken technique and forged an unbreakable bond with Hanabi, a kunoichi of the Scarlet Sect. But when Hanzo's betrayal and his brother's disappearance shattered their hopes for peace, Hayabusa realized that the moonlight that had always guided him was gone. Yet, he gripped his blade firmly, determined to forge ahead through the shadows, following his brother's nindo.",

    "shortStory": "Granger, a demon hunter who walks the line between human and demon, always preferred to keep to himself. But if someone could enter his world, they would realize how terrifying it is—the incessant howls and shrill cries constantly deafening his ears and heart. When he draws his demon-devouring weapons and unleashes a hail of bullets, the agonizing howls of demons become a requiem playing in the depths of his soul. Only the intertwining of their death shrieks and the sound of gunfire can drown out the noise that torments him daily. Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

Born in the Agelta Drylands, Bruno grew up in a remote village surrounded by poverty. But it was those hardships that fueled his longing for freedom. As soon as he was of age, Bruno joined a caravan in hopes of seeing the world. Unfortunately, a tragic accident robbed him of his legs and his freedom. But fate was on his side, for when the caravan passed him through Eruditio, Bruno was offered a second chance. Although it came with great risk, he was so touched by the passion of the city that he decided to take that chance, and in the end of his courage paid off. He not only regained his legs, but was now faster than ever. Instead of continuing his travels, he decided to remain in Eruditio and become its protector. He vowed to uphold the ideals of the Oasis in the desert and help others find true freedom.",

Tearfully, her mother bade her farewell as she succumbed to the cold embrace of blizzard. Aurora slumbered for a thousand years atop the peak. Upon her awakening, the truth dawned on her: genuine eternity lay in fleeting emotions, such as her mother's final comforting smile. Thus, Aurora resolved to bestow this eternity upon the world.

If granted, all of the one's memories, longings, and emotions would be left tot he goddess, who would cherish them until the end of time. And thus, they would live on the eternity.",
